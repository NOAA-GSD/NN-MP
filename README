Neural Network Microphysics (NN-MP)

The neuraltmp.F code (NN-MP) is a neural network emulator of the Thompson microphysics code used in the NNMB and ARW WRF Numerical Weather Prediction (WNP) models, developed by Vladimir Krasnopolsky of the Environmental Modeling Center. NN-MP was trained with data generated by the Global Systems Division with the NNMP model using the original Thompson scheme. The software includes interfaces of the NN-MP code with the ARW WRF code, which is an open-source code in the public domain, with no restriction on its use. After further testing, the NN- MP code can replace the Thompson microphysics scheme in NWP models to provide significant savings in cpu time.
